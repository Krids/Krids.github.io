            <h2 class="title text">Profile</h2>
            <p>31 years old, graduated in Software Engineering with a general average over 9,2, he often reads books
                and scientific articles and believes that the best way to make decisions is through data, with a
                data-oriented culture being essential for companies and startups. Believes in communication and
                prefers the truth to be told independently, whether it will hurt or not, because only then can
                teams thrive. Prefers a million times to solve the biggest problem encountered than doing repetitive
                work. Finally,  is a libertarian and believes that we must be free to make our decisions, as long as
                those decisions do not harm other people.</p>

                    <p>This project was developed during the mini course "Data Science with R" given by Professor Doctor
                        Paolo Moser at the University of the State of Santa Catarina. In this course we carry out an
                        exploratory analysis of a dataset with information about computers, the ultimate goal being
                        supervised learning to determine the price of the computer according to its characteristics.</p>

                    <p>This project was carried out in the Data Science I course given by Udacity and aimed to carry
                        out an exploratory analysis of data from a bicycle rental company. It was possible to draw
                        several insights to better understand the business, how the weather affects the rental of
                        bicycles or even what is the best and worst schedule for bicycle rentals.</p>

                    <p>This project was carried out as a technical test for the vacancy of data scientist at
                        DTI Digital. The objective was to carry out the analysis of the questions regarding
                        Perceived Enjoyment. For that, exploratory data analysis techniques were used and several
                        groups of teachers and their answers to these questions were verified. Thus, other ideas
                        about the data were drawn.</p>

                    <p>In this project the company asked to create, deploy, and monitor a risk assessment ML model that will estimate the attrition risk of each of the company's 10,000 clients. 
                        If the model you create and deploy is accurate, it will enable the client managers to contact the clients with the highest risk and avoid losing clients and revenue.</p>

                    <p>This project is part of Unit 4: Deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production. 
                        The problem is to build a machine learning application that predicts an employer's annual income more than $50K using the census income dataset from UCI. 
                        The application is deployed using FastAPI, with CI and CD using Github Actions and Heroku respectively.</p>

                    <p>In this project we are working for a property management company renting rooms 
                        and properties for short periods of time on various rental platforms. 
                        So we need to estimate the typical price for a given property based on the price of similar properties. 
                        The company receives new data in bulk every week. 
                        The model needs to be retrained with the same cadence, necessitating an end-to-end pipeline that can be reused.</p>

                        Machine learning algorithms have been used to achieve this objective. 
                        PEP8 standard has been followed while writing the Python code. 
                        Python Codes could be found in the repository along with the testing and logging python script.</p>

                    <p>In this project it was predetermined that people who earn more than 50 thousand annually were
                        more likely to make donations to charity. Thus, through a database containing characteristics
                        of people who earned above and below 50 thousand, it was asked to create a model capable of
                        determining whether the person earns more or less than 50 thousand per year according to
                        their characteristics.</p>

                    <p>In order to learn more about the financial market, this machine learning course for finance
                        was held. It was possible to learn about how to analyze stocks separately and how to
                        analyze the performance of stock portfolios. Regression, visualization techniques,
                        bollinger bands and moving averages were used.</p>

                    <p>This project was completed as a conclusion of the Machine Learning Engineer course, from Udacity.
                        However, it was chosen because it is a Kaggle competition. The objective was to develop a
                        model to predict whether the market would rise or fall according to news labeled as good or
                        bad. The results were not the best, but several concepts were studied in this project.</p>

                        it was proposed to segment customers and reduce the dimensionality in standardized data on the
                        quantity of products sold in each category. PCA and clustering techniques were used to analyze

                        problems like missing and repeated data. It was proposed to perform a dimensionality
                        reduction and analyze the main component of the data. In addition, pre-processing was
                        performed to eliminate missing data.</p>
