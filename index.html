            <h2 class="title text">Profile</h2>
            <p>28 years old, graduated in Software Engineering with a general average over 9, he often reads books
                and scientific articles and believes that the best way to make decisions is through data, with a
                data-oriented culture being essential for companies and startups. Believes in communication and
                prefers the truth to be told independently, whether it will hurt or not, because only then can
                teams thrive. Prefers a million times to solve the biggest problem encountered than doing repetitive
                work. Finally,  is a libertarian and believes that we must be free to make our decisions, as long as
                those decisions do not harm other people.</p>

                    <p>This project was developed during the mini course "Data Science with R" given by Professor Doctor
                        Paolo Moser at the University of the State of Santa Catarina. In this course we carry out an
                        exploratory analysis of a dataset with information about computers, the ultimate goal being
                        supervised learning to determine the price of the computer according to its characteristics.</p>

                    <p>This project was carried out in the Data Science I course given by Udacity and aimed to carry
                        out an exploratory analysis of data from a bicycle rental company. It was possible to draw
                        several insights to better understand the business, how the weather affects the rental of
                        bicycles or even what is the best and worst schedule for bicycle rentals.</p>

                    <p>This project was carried out as a technical test for the vacancy of data scientist at
                        DTI Digital. The objective was to carry out the analysis of the questions regarding
                        Perceived Enjoyment. For that, exploratory data analysis techniques were used and several
                        groups of teachers and their answers to these questions were verified. Thus, other ideas
                        about the data were drawn.</p>

                    <p>In this project it was predetermined that people who earn more than 50 thousand annually were
                        more likely to make donations to charity. Thus, through a database containing characteristics
                        of people who earned above and below 50 thousand, it was asked to create a model capable of
                        determining whether the person earns more or less than 50 thousand per year according to
                        their characteristics.</p>

                    <p>In order to learn more about the financial market, this machine learning course for finance
                        was held. It was possible to learn about how to analyze stocks separately and how to
                        analyze the performance of stock portfolios. Regression, visualization techniques,
                        bollinger bands and moving averages were used.</p>

                    <p>This project was completed as a conclusion of the Machine Learning Engineer course, from Udacity.
                        However, it was chosen because it is a Kaggle competition. The objective was to develop a
                        model to predict whether the market would rise or fall according to news labeled as good or
                        bad. The results were not the best, but several concepts were studied in this project.</p>

                        it was proposed to segment customers and reduce the dimensionality in standardized data on the
                        quantity of products sold in each category. PCA and clustering techniques were used to analyze
                        the data.</p>

                        problems like missing and repeated data. It was proposed to perform a dimensionality
                        reduction and analyze the main component of the data. In addition, pre-processing was
                        performed to eliminate missing data.</p>

                    <p>Two notebooks were developed to study the modules used in natural language processing (NLP),
                        word2vec which makes a vectorization of textual words and a learning process using the dataset
                        not mnist.</p>

                    <p>This project carried out in the discipline of computational intelligence during the graduation
                        in software engineering proposed the creation of a model capable of verifying handwritten digits
                        (dataset semeion). In addition, the model was put into production in an android application
                        using the tensorflow lite.</p>

                    <p>The Japanese game sokoban aims to move the boxes to the corresponding positions, using a
                        character to push the boxes without letting them get stuck. For that, several search methods
                        (width, depth and others) were developed, to find the solution for some maps proposed by
                        the professor in the discipline of Computational Intelligence during the graduation in software
                        engineering.</p>

                    <p>This project was carried out in the subject of Project Integrator three, during the Software
                        Engineering course held at UDESC. The objective was to find a click with a greater sum of
                        the weights within a graph. That is, a click is a sub-graph in which all vertices are connected
                        by an edge. Several types of heuristic searches were generated for the problem, such as Iterated
                        Local Search.</p>
